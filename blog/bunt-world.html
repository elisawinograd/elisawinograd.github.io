						I have been nurturing myself with the food that I save from the bio supermarket with The Real Junk Food Project in Berlin for a few years now (around 3). The way it works is that the supermarket seperates the food they are going to throw away for us. We then come in, sort what should REALLY be thrown away from what is still edible, take a few things that we want or need and prepare the rest to be redistributed. In Germany about 30% of the food produced is wasted. We make sure to minimize this as much as possible. 
					</p>

						For me the saving doesn't stop when I stroll out of the supermarket backdoors. I often redistribute the food on my lovely bike, which makes the transport easier and so much more fufilling than depending on a car or the train. There are a few fariteilers in Berlin, which are places designated to leave food for anyone to take. They are run by another food saving organization called Food Sharing which admirebly makes sure that they are clean and taken care of. They are equipped with fridges, most of the time, and host a house for other items that people want to keep on circling around through others hands (i.e. clothes, books, etc.). Some are even hosted by community bars or cafes!

						Through the years I have helped with the food collections (with many thanks to the infrastructure and networking of the Real Junk Food Project) I have had the luck to form part of a constant team of passionate food savers that gather every saturday for this act of volunteering. Our meticulous team makes sure that nothing goes to the bin. Sometimes I even gather the left of seeds that have fallen off the bread loaves and use them as a crunchy and underrated salad topping. Although the fairteilers offer a great back up solution for the food that is left over, we feel more conciously sound when we are able to distribute the food to people who are guaranteed to responsibly make use of it. Neighbors, friends and sometimes Homeless shelters form a part of this network. Bunnies and their farm friends have also the opportunity to enjoy the leaves that would otherwise fill the brown containers of food which will be burned by the state for energy. Because this food is already in its second stage of life, it is like a fragile porcelain glass which must be handled with care before it reaches its end. I therefore always cross my fingers and hope, that the people who get their hands on these unappreciated gifts of the Earth are able to make use of them and not let them end up in their predetermined destiny. With so much care, I regardless sometimes end up having to through out a leaf or two and dispose of items which, although not even ripe, won't find their tasty way out. In this journey, I have learned a few valuable techniques that have helped me prolong the life of particular food items. I would like to share these with you:

						What inspired me initially to write this post, however, was the buntness in my meals since I started working with this project. It has certeinly changed my eating habbits, inspired me to try to new things and shown me the value of many food iteams. I sometime wonder if I would have even tried some of the veggies if not having them saved them from the trash. It also makes me even more concious of how food travels around the world and how the taste is altered depending on if it came from thousands of kilometers away or if it was grown closer by. For many things about this opportunity I am thankful but most importantly, on this topic, for being able to try to save the food that traveled such a long way and would not have been able to be consumed otherwise.
