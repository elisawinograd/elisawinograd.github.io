				<h1 class="project-title"> My first blog post </h1>

						I think, and I hope, that this will be the post with the most boring subject that I write. Why is it boring? Well, you may find it interesting, but for me it is just a way of breaking the ice and jumping straight into this thing. Maybe not so boring after all, I tend to be a bit pessimistic sometimes. Anyways, the reason why I would consider it "boring" is because I will just rant about my decision making process in making this blog, and why it took me so long to make it. </br> </br>
						Doesn't this image inspire you to write?

						One of the reasons why I decided to make a blog is because most of the great designers I know, reflect about their work through writing. But there are many other reasons behind it because I don't want this blog to be just a design blog, I want it to be about my personal journey though life. Or rather, in a less phylosophical way, a place where I can write about things I want others to see. I have always liked writing, and since I was about 8 years old I have had a journal. But writing in a public interface is far different than writing in your personal notebook that no one can (or should) read. This is the reason why I was so hesitant about it for so long. Why would I tell people what I am thinking? Why would I spend the time to write publicly? Well now I see that it is a different type of writing and it is actually quite liberating. I would actually encourage a lot of people to do it.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						So I guess this will be a short one since the topic is not too extensive. I hope my posts will get better and better as time goes on. Thank you for reading.

						Maybe your perspective on the same plant is now different.
