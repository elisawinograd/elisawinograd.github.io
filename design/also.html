					<p class="paragraph"> 
						I was hired by <a href="https://www.also.com"> ALSO </a> in June 2018 and worked with them until February 2019. 
						ALSO is a partner of Microsoft which specializes in digital software and solutions for IT clients in 28 different 
						countries. I formed part of the freelance team at ALSO and worked on a variety of marketing campaigns and landing page
						designs. For the marketing campaigns I made banners in different sizes for all social media channels using the styling
						that I implemented in the landing page designs. This is also included designing print materials or flyers when necessary. 
						I designed the landing pages in Sketch and worked with the developers using Zeplin. I often also made the templates for the
						landing pages using <a href="https://unbounce.com/"> Unbounce. </a>
						I often had to make custom icons for 
						the pages and source stock images for the ads. This made my work with ALSO very diverse and enriching. 
						Below I will present some of the most involved projects I worked on for ALSO.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> SPLA Landing Page, Banners and Report </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						SPLA (Services Provider License Agreement) is provided by microsoft for customers to lisence Microsoft products 
						eligibly. ALSO wanted to offer a software, that would automate the reporting of SPLA for customers not to have
						to do this manually each month. Using the ALSO branding and look-and-feel I created a landing page for this service. 
						I also made banners for Linkedin, the ALSO newsletter and the ALSO webshop in 5 different 
						sizes in 8 different languages. In addition I created a report with the price changes for ALSO to share with 
						potential customers. Below you can see the design for these three components of the project.
