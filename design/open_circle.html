				<h1 class="project-title"> The Parents Circle Family Forum </h1>
				<article class="project-article">
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						"The Parents Circle - Families Forum (PCFF) is a joint Palestinian Israeli organization of over 600 families, all of whom have lost a close family member as a result of the prolonged conflict. Joint activities have shown that the reconciliation between individuals and nations is possible and it is this insight that they are trying to pass on to both sides of the conflict." – From the about section of the website <a class="inline-link-projects" href="http://www.theparentscircle.com/Content.aspx?ID=2#.WZglHpMjGu4"> here</a> </br>
						</br>
						I worked on a re-branding project for the organization in order to make the logo, the website and the print material more appealing to existing and future members. </br> </br>
						The first thing I did when approached with this project was to brainstorm different names for the organization. Since the existing name was not widely recognized yet, it was a good opportunity to figure out if it was something that possible members found approachable. </br></br>
						I conducted interviews with existing members to find out what they thought about the organization and how they felt about the name. I also interviewed people that had no idea what the organization was and asked them blindly what thoughts came to mind when they read the organization name. After analyzing these results, I decided that more appropriate and memorable name would be Open Circle translated in Hebrew "ma-agal patuach" and Arabic "al-halaka al-maftooha". In this way, the name would be more inviting to people from all cultures. The subline "bereaved families for peace" integrated in the logo clarifies what the sessions are about. </br> </br>
						I made a variety of sketches before reaching the final logo design. The final color palette was based around the imagery displayed on the website, pulling from the vibrant colors of different cultures working together.

						With a new logo designed, I had to think about the entire rebranding for the organization. 
						Since the organization already has an established website and brand, I had to take the existing material and analyse how I could improve on it, without eliminated all the positive efforts it already reached. I began by making a site map of the we website and simplifying the content.

						My initial designs for the website were simple and pulled from the color palette developed for the new brand. I also had in mind the three languages and how the website would change depending on the direction of the language. Unfortunately, due to lack of time and budget, I was not able to create prototypes and test these designs with the users or potential members. </br> </br>
						In addition to the logo and website, I created print material for the organization to distribute at different events and conferences. Because the organization did not have the budget for implemented the rebrand, these were only used for samples when presenting the new brand concepts.

						If I were to do this project again, I would first make sure to talk to the founders and all the relevant stakeholders to see if the implementation would be possible. From there I would discuss things such as changing the name of the organization and present them with the user testing to validate how this would impact the brand vision. It was a good experience regardless and I hope one day in the future there will be the budget to do a more proper re-brand with the possibility of implementation.
