					<p class="paragraph"> 
						<a href="https://tradebay.co/"> Tradebay</a> is a platform which helps buyers and sellers navigate 
						the fruit industry global marketplace freely and independently. In 2021 I joined and helped them restructure 
                        and re-design their customer app. Tradebay is composed of a public-facing website for everyone to view and a private customer app for registered users. 
                        I worked closely with the founders to decide what should be on the public-facing website and what information the users
						should see when registered in their dashboard. The dashboard has a lot of different information and needs to be tailored
						for both buyers and sellers of the fruit industry. Due to this complexity, I made a lot of sketches and wireframing 
						before jumping into the design. Below I describe this process.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> How the Customer App is Structured </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						One is able to register for the Tradebay App either as a seller of fruit or a buyer of fruit. If you are a buyer
						you are able to look at what is in the marketplace (a catalog with the fruit being offered) and make an offer to 
						of the producers with the amount you would like buy and how much you would like to pay. If there is a fruit variety
						which you would like to buy but do not see in the marketplace you can create a fruit listing with the fruit type
						you "demand". In the same way, sellers make fruit listings with the fruit they have to offer. Buyers and sellers
						interact with each other within the app to negotiate which fruits are sold and bought. The Dashboard for users of
						Tradebay consists of "the Marketplace", a place where you can see which fruits are being offered and which are
						on the demand, "My listings", a section where you can edit the listings you have made with the fruit you want to sell
						or the fruit you want to buy, "My organization", a section for you to describe how your company is called, what you do, etc., 
						and "Inquiries", a sort of "chat-room" where you can talk to other users who want to buy or sell products. One of the first
						sections I worked on with Tradebay was the Markeplace.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> A general refresh </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						One of the first things I worked on for Tradebay was a general refresh of the user app. I began to think how the navigation and structure
						of the existing app could be improved and what the working priority for this should be. I looked at inspiration and started to mark
						wireframes of ideas which I presented to the team. Below are some examples of the slides I presented as well as a screenshot of the
						how the user app looked when I joined Tradebay. You can download the full presentation <a href="../images/design/tradebay/app/ewinograd_tradebay_marketplace_feb2021.pdf" target="_blank"> here. </a>
