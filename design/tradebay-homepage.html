				<article class="project-article">
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						In 2021 I joined <a href="https://tradebay.co/"> Tradebay</a>. Tradabay is a platform which helps buyers and sellers navigate 
						the global fruit marketplace freely and independently. The product is composed of a public-facing website for everyone to view and a private customer 
						app for registered users. Given that most users navigate on their mobile devices, Tradebay places great 
						emphasis on the mobile interaction of both the website and the customer application. 
						I therefore had the opportunity to work on scalable
                        designs (for mobile and desktop) tailored to the complicated infrastructure of the Tradebay product.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Defining Tradebay Branding </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						The first thing Tradebay wanted to define was a new branding image. I proposed a variety of color and typography variations. 
                        The final decision was made together: a bright and organic color-palette with a serious and modern look.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Restructuring of the Tradebay Website </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						Once we had decided on appropriate colors and fonts I applied the new look-and-feel to the public-facing website. 
                        We worked together on restructuring the information on the website. To do so we created a virtual site-map which you can 
                        see below.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Design Research for the new Website </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						After agreeing on the information that should be on the website I gathered research and inspiration and 
						created wireframes and flows which I presented to the team. Below are some screenshots of the presentation
						I shared with Tradebay in order to show the team some ideas for the website re-design.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Website Design and Development </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						After deciding on a layout direction I re-designed the existing website. I provided the team with a few designs
						to choose from. Once a design was decided upon I worked closely with the developer to create the new public
						website. I was given access to the code and was able to make a few UI fixes before pushing the website live. Below
						is a screenshot of the old public-facing website and a screenshot of the new website. To view further projects I did with 
						Tradebay please click  <a href="tradebay-app.html" target="_blank"> here. </a>

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Dashboard Features and Improvements </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						Apart from working on the UI and information arquitecture of the public facing website I helped Tradebay improve and develop new
						features for the dashboard. This required a lot of UX-thinking and team work.
