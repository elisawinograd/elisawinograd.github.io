					<p class="paragraph"> 
						In 2021 I joined <a href="https://tradebay.co/"> Tradebay </a>. Tradabay is a platform created by a 
                        swedish team which helps buyers and sellers from the fruit industry navigate the marketplace without 
                        having to go through mediators. Tradebay has a public-facing website and a private app for its users. 
                        They place great enfasis on the mobile interaction of both the website and the dashboard application 
                        given that most users navigate on their mobile devices. I therefore had the opportinuty to work on scalable 
                        designs that fufilled the complicated infrastructure of the tradebay product.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Defining Tradebay Branding </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						The first thing Tradebay wanted to define was a new branding image. I proposed a variety of color and typography variations. 
                        The final decision was made together: a bright and organic color-palette with a serious and modern look.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						Once we had decided on appropriate colors and fonts I applied the new look and feel to the public-facing website. 
                        We worked together on restructuring the information on the website. To do so we created a virtual site-map which you can 
                        see below.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						After agreeing on the information that should be on the website I gathered research and inspiration and 
						created wireframes and flows which I presented to the team. Below are some screenshots of the presentation
						I shared with Tradebay in order to show the team some ideas for the website re-design.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Website Design and Development </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						After deciding on a layout direction I re-designed the existing website. I provided the team with a few designs
						to choose from. Once a design was decided upon I worked closely with the developer to create the new public
						website. I was given access to the code and was able to make a few UI fixes before pushing the website live. Below
						is a screenshot of the old public-facing website and a screenshot of the new website. So long it has not been
						modified, the new live website can also be seen <a href="https://tradebay.co/"> here </a>.

						Apart from working on the UI and information arquitecture of the public facing website I helped Tradebay improve and develop new
						features for the dashboard. This required a lot of UX-thinking and team work.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						One of the  biggest campaigns I helped HYGH with was the Greentech Festival in Templehof, Berlin. In order to engage customers with the HYGH platform, they provided a sign up platform in which users could chose a screen to display their advertisements during the festival. I created the design for this flow. I based the designs on the existing styleguide we created and the styleguide provided by the Greentech Festival team. It was a challenge to combine both brands and still retain each of their unique identities. Apart from the new platform design, I designed screens for HYGH to display through out the festival as well as helped them with the imagery for social media.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						I enjoyed very much working with the HYGH team. Exchanging ideas with the marketing team and working closely with the developers made the design process inspiring and smooth. Although I was mainly working remotely, communication was always clear and there was a lot of respect within the team structure. I look forward to assisting them with design projects in the future!
