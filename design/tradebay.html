					<p class="paragraph"> 
						In 2021 I joined <a href="https://tradebay.co/"> Tradebay </a>. Tradabay is a platform created by a 
                        swedish team which helps buyers and sellers from the fruit industry navigate the marketplace without 
                        having to go through mediators. Tradebay has a public-facing website and a private app for its users. 
                        They place great enfasis on the mobile interaction of both the website and the dashboard application 
                        given that most users navigate on their mobile devices. I therefore had the opportinuty to work on scalable 
                        designs that fufilled the complicated infrastructure of the tradebay product.

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Defining Tradebay Branding </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						The first thing Tradebay wanted to define was a new branding image. I proposed a variety of color and typography variations. 
                        The final decision was made together: a bright and organic color-palette with a serious and modern look.

						Once we had decided on appropriate colors and fonts I applied the new look and feel to the public-facing website. 
                        We worked together on restructuring the information on the website. To do so we created a virtual site-map which you can 
                        see below.

						I created a design system for the top image of each page. I sourced and edited each image myself. Surprisingly, the most challenging page was the Team page. After the first launch of the re-design, we worked on a few iterations. It was challenging to find an innovative design for such a simple page that would fit in the responsive grid and matched the aesthetic style of the other assets. It was also time consuming to crop and color correct each team image. In the future, I would have liked to find a more scalable design system for this feature. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions, we settled for design below.

						One of the  biggest campaigns I helped HYGH with was the Greentech Festival in Templehof, Berlin. In order to engage customers with the HYGH platform, they provided a sign up platform in which users could chose a screen to display their advertisements during the festival. I created the design for this flow. I based the designs on the existing styleguide we created and the styleguide provided by the Greentech Festival team. It was a challenge to combine both brands and still retain each of their unique identities. Apart from the new platform design, I designed screens for HYGH to display through out the festival as well as helped them with the imagery for social media.

						I enjoyed very much working with the HYGH team. Exchanging ideas with the marketing team and working closely with the developers made the design process inspiring and smooth. Although I was mainly working remotely, communication was always clear and there was a lot of respect within the team structure. I look forward to assisting them with design projects in the future!
