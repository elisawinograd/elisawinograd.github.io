				<article class="project-article">
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						FriendHood is a platonic friendship mobile app for those who are looking for meet new and interested people in the city they live. </br>
						</br>
						I joined FriendHood and its two founders at the end of 2017 to help them improve their iOS and Android Apps and acquire more customers. In 2018, we decided to launch the Plans feature because we noticed that a lot of people were making plans to meet in person but not actually meeting. After user interviews, we also found that it could be less intimidating to meet a group of people rather than one single person. </br>

					<h2 class="paragraph-title"> Brainstorming the Plans Feature </h2>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						We brainstormed a lot before starting to design this feature. The FriendHood app is built to show users other people with the same interests and age range. When brainstorming the plans feature, we realized that for users to be able to meet people within their interests, they needed to indicate which profiles they found interesting or not. For this, I designed a new feature for saving and hiding other users profiles. In this way, we could implement the plans feature in such a way that only your "favorite" profiles would be able to join and view your plans. The save and hide feature seemed straight forward to design but there was actually a lot of information architecture and UI design changes to consider.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						First I had to consider where the "saved" profiles would appear. In the original design for the discover tab (where you find peoples profiles) there were two sections: people and activities. But the idea with saving someone else's profile is that you can later look at the profile again and then invite the person to do an activity. Since the plan feature was coming soon, and the people and activities would somehow be in two categories, we decided collectively that the best decision would be to move the activities to a different tab in the primary navigation give us the room to have the sub-navigation in the discover tab to be "Discover" and "Saved". By doing this, we had to change the name of the Discover tab to People and come up with new iconography for the bottom navigation. I also updated the design for the secondary navigation tabs to make them more in line with our style and improve the user experience.

						After discussing all the tecnical restrictions and desired design outcomes, I made digital wireframes to show how the feature could look.
