				<h1 class="project-title"> HYGH - The Future of Advertisement </h1>
				<article class="project-article">
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						I worked with <a href="https://www.hygh.tech"> HYGH </a> from June to October 2019 on a variety of projects. HYGH is a company that specializes in outdoor advertising. Making the high-demanded advertisement displays available to individual businesses and product owners. </br>
						</br>
						I was approached by HYGH to help them re-design their current website and unite their visual identity. When I joined the team, they had three different branding styles: one for their customer platform, one for their landing page and a different one for social media. I started by re-designing their homepage along with the responsive tablet and mobile views. I then provided them with a new brand styleguide and visual guide to bring coherence to their visual identity. </br>

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						During my first meeting with the HYGH team, we spoke about the information that needed to be on the new website and the visual aesthetic they had in mind. I then prepared a presentation with the visuals of the current design and possible improvements as well inspiration. Through wireframes I clearly visualized my suggestion for UX improvements.

						After deciding on the final concepts, I worked on the UI of the new website. I was surprised at how smooth it was to work with the HYGH team. They were very open to the idea of stepping away from the landing page structure which all of their competitors were using. We re-arranged the information architecture in a way that made more sense from a user interaction perspective. I then worked quickly and under pressure to finish the designs before a big investors conference. Along the way I created a guide for the visual assets and new brand styleguide.

						I created a design system for the top image of each page. I sourced and edited each image myself. Surprisingly, the most challenging page was the Team page. After the first launch of the re-design, we worked on a few iterations. It was challenging to find an innovative design for such a simple page that would fit in the responsive grid and matched the aesthetic style of the other assets. It was also time consuming to crop and color correct each team image. In the future, I would have liked to find a more scalable design system for this feature. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions, we settled for design below.

						One of the  biggest campaigns I helped HYGH with was the Greentech Festival in Templehof, Berlin. The Greentech Festival is held in Berlin every year and invites projects that have innovative technology related ideas for a greener future.

						One of the  biggest campaigns I helped HYGH with was the Greentech Festival in Templehof, Berlin. In order to engage customers with the HYGH platform, they provided a sign up platform in which users could chose a screen to display their advertisements during the festival. I created the design for this flow. I based the designs on the existing styleguide we created and the styleguide provided by the Greentech Festival team. It was a challenge to combine both brands and still retain each of their unique identities. Apart from the new platform design, I designed screens for HYGH to display through out the festival as well as helped them with the imagery for social media.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						I enjoyed very much working with the HYGH team. Exchanging ideas with the marketing team and working closely with the developers made the design process inspiring and smooth. Although I was mainly working remotely, communication was always clear and there was a lot of respect within the team structure. I look forward to assisting them with design projects in the future!
