				<h1 class="project-title"> HYGH - The Future of Advertisement </h1>
				<article class="project-article">
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						I worked with <a href="https://www.hygh.tech"> HYGH </a> from June to October 2019 on a veriety of projects. HYGH is a company that specializes in outdoor advertising. Making the high-demanded advertisement displays available to individual businesses and product ownders. </br>
						</br>
						I was approached by HYGH to help them re-design their current website and unite their visual identity. When I joined the team, they had three different branding styles: one for their customer platform, one for their landing page and a different one for social media. I started by re-designing their homepage along with the responsive tablet and mobile views. I then provided them with a new brand styleguide and visual guide to bring coherence to their visual identity. </br>

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						During my first meeting with the HYGH team, we spoke about the information that needed to be on the new website and the visual aesthetic they had in mind. I then prepared a presentation with the visuals of the current design and possible improvements as well inspiration. Through wireframes I clearly visualized my suggestion for UX improvements.

					<p class="paragraph"> 
						After deciding on the final concepts, I worked on the UI of the new website. I was surprised at how smooth it was to work with the HYGH team. They were very open to the idea of stepping away from the landing page structure all their competitors were using. We re-arranged the information arquitecture in a way that made more sense from a user interaction perspective. I then worked quickly and under pressure to finish the designs before a big investors conference. Along the way I created a guide for the visual assets and new brand styleguide. 
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph"> 
						I created a design system for the top image of each page which I sourced and edited myself. Surpsingly, the most challenging page was the Team page. After the first launch of the re-design, we worked on a few iterations. It was challenging to find an innovative design for such a simple page that would fit in the responsive grid and matched the aesthetic style of the other assets. It was also time consuming to crop and color correct each team image. In the future, I would have liked to find a more scalable design system for this feature. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions, we settled for design below.
